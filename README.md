# FreshBunks
We collaborated in a cross-functional team to design and develop a Laundry system for hosteler using Agile and Scrum methodologies. The FreshBunks project is an agile project aiming to create a user-friendly website for Veronica Hosteler and launderers.
I contributed as a Quality Analyst and Technical Writer, documenting user stories, sprint backlogs, and system functionalities and utilizing sprints for continuous completion, facilitated by daily stand-up meetings and sprint reviews/retrospectives. The FreshBunks project is an agile project aiming to create a user-friendly website for Veronica Hostelites and launderers. It provides real-time updates on orders, cost calculation, calendar widgets, secure payment integration, and FAQ section. The main aim is to create a simplified user interface avoiding WhatsApp communication and features like user registration, dashboard interface, payment processing, laundry booking, order tracking schedules, and profile management.
